> Splunk software requires a CPU processor that supports the x86-64-v2 (Intel/AMD) or NEON (ARM) architecture. Most modern processors manufactured after 2008 include this support. Support for the use of processors that do not meet this requirement is deprecated in Splunk Enterprise 9.3.
> 
> Support for the use of processors that do not meet this requirement will be removed in the next major or minor version of Splunk Enterprise after version 9.3.
> 
> This CPU requirement and the notice of deprecation does not apply to the Universal Forwarder package.
